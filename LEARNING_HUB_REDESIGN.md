# Learning Hub Course Detail Page Redesign

## Overview
This document outlines the redesign of the Learning Hub course detail pages to provide a more engaging and visually appealing user experience. The redesign focuses on improving navigation, module progression, and overall layout.

## Key Changes

### 1. Mini Floating Sidebar
- Replaced tab navigation with a floating sidebar on the right side
- Provides clear visual indication of progress through modules
- Shows completion status with checkmarks for finished modules
- Sticky positioning ensures navigation is always accessible

### 2. Improved Module Navigation
- Added functional "Next Module" and "Previous Module" buttons
- Dynamic module progression based on the current active module
- Smooth scrolling when switching between modules
- Back to Courses link when on the first module

### 3. Visual Improvements
- Better content structure with cards and visual hierarchy
- Consistent styling across all modules
- Animation effects for smooth transitions between modules
- Mobile-responsive design with sidebar hiding on smaller screens

## Components Created/Modified

1. **MiniFloatingSidebar.tsx**
   - A new component that provides the floating navigation interface
   - Uses framer-motion for smooth animations
   - Indicates current and completed modules

2. **ModuleNavigation.tsx**
   - Handles "Next" and "Previous" module navigation
   - Dynamic button states based on current module position

3. **CourseDetailTemplate.tsx**
   - Updated to accommodate the new floating sidebar design
   - Modified content display to show one module at a time
   - Improved responsive layout

4. **Prompting101Content.tsx**
   - Redesigned to work with the new navigation system
   - Content now displays in an organized, module-by-module format

## Usage
The new design is automatically applied to all course detail pages. Content creators can continue to add modules to courses using the same structure, and the navigation system will automatically adapt to the number of modules.

## Future Improvements
- Add progress tracking to remember completed modules for users
- Implement module completion checks based on interactive elements
- Add transition effects between module content
