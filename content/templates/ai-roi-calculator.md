## How to Use This AI ROI Calculator Template

### Step 1: Gather Accurate Input Data
- Consult with finance, IT, operations, and relevant department heads
- Use historical data when available
- Document all assumptions clearly
- Consider both direct and indirect costs/benefits

### Step 2: Complete the Calculator
- Fill in all applicable fields
- For uncertain values, use conservative estimates
- Calculate the payback period, ROI, NPV, and IRR
- Perform sensitivity analysis with different scenarios

### Step 3: Interpret the Results
- **Payback Period**: How long until the investment breaks even
- **ROI**: Percentage return on the total investment
- **NPV**: Present value of all future cash flows
- **IRR**: Rate of return that makes the NPV zero

### Step 4: Make Data-Driven Decisions
- Compare this AI initiative against other potential investments
- Establish clear success metrics based on the ROI analysis
- Set review periods to reassess actual ROI against projections
- Use sensitivity analysis to understand risk factors

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Overestimating Benefits**: Be realistic about efficiency gains and adoption rates
2. **Underestimating Costs**: Factor in hidden costs like change management and training
3. **Ignoring Time Value**: Remember that benefits realized sooner are more valuable
4. **Neglecting Non-Quantifiable Benefits**: Some of the most significant advantages may not have direct dollar values
5. **Failing to Reassess**: ROI should be recalculated periodically as actual data becomes available

By using this template, you'll create a comprehensive ROI analysis that helps justify AI investments and set realistic expectations for business impact.
