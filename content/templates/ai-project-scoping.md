# AI Project Scoping Template

Use this framework to properly scope and define your AI implementation projects. A well-defined scope is critical for AI project success.

```
# AI Project Scoping Framework

## How to Use This Template

### Before the Kickoff Meeting
1. Pre-fill as many sections as possible with your current knowledge
2. Identify information gaps and who needs to provide that information
3. Distribute the pre-filled template to all stakeholders 24+ hours in advance

### During the Scoping Session
1. Work through each section methodically
2. Document decisions and action items
3. Identify dependencies between sections
4. Specifically address the Risk Assessment section as a group

### After the Session
1. Finalize the document based on the meeting
2. Obtain sign-off from the executive sponsor
3. Create a central repository for this document and related artifacts
4. Schedule regular reviews to reassess scope as the project progresses

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Unrealistic Expectations**: Many organizations overestimate what AI can do or underestimate implementation complexity
2. **Data Quality Assumption**: Never assume your data is "ready" - always verify quality, completeness, and accessibility
3. **Scope Creep**: Establish a rigorous change control process from the beginning
4. **Overlooking Change Management**: AI projects often require significant user adaptation and training
5. **Underestimating Resources**: AI projects typically require more data engineering than anticipated

By using this template, you'll create a comprehensive scope document that helps ensure your AI initiative is well-defined, properly resourced, and positioned for success.
