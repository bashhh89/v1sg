## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many emails should my campaign include?

For most campaigns, 3-7 emails provide enough touchpoints without overwhelming subscribers. Welcome sequences and complex sales funnels may require more.

### How long should I wait between emails?

It depends on your campaign purpose. For urgency-driven campaigns (flash sales, limited-time offers), daily emails may be appropriate. For educational sequences, 2-4 days between emails is usually better.

### How can I improve open rates for my campaign?

Focus on compelling subject lines, test different sending times, ensure your sender name is recognizable, and segment your audience for more relevant content.

### Should I include images in every email?

Not necessarily. While images enhance certain messages, some high-performing emails are text-only, especially when they appear more personal. Test both approaches.

### How can I measure my campaign's success?

Beyond open and click rates, track campaign-specific conversion metrics tied to your goal (purchases, sign-ups, downloaded resources). Compare performance to your baseline metrics.
