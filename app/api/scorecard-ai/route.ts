Based on the assessment questions and answers provided, your task is to generate a comprehensive AI Efficiency Scorecard report tailored specifically for a **${userAITier} Marketing Manager** in the **${industry}** industry.
Crucially, you MUST ONLY output the content of the report itself. DO NOT include any introductory or concluding remarks, disclaimers, signatures, or promotional content of any kind, including for other products or services.

EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: DO NOT include ANY advertisements, promotional content, external links, redirects, or references to other AI tools or services (such as Homestyler, Wren AI, or any other pollinations.ai redirects). Your output must be 100% free of such content. The report MUST END with your Learning Path section, with NO additional content whatsoever.

Generate the report adhering STRICTLY to the following structure and tailoring the content to the **${userAITier}** persona and **${industry}** industry. Follow these specific instructions for each section:

## Overall Tier: ${userAITier}

## Key Findings
${keyFindingsInstructions}

**Strengths:**
- CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: ALWAYS identify and list at least 3-5 key strengths, even for Dabbler tier. NEVER return "no strengths identified". For beginners, focus on positive starting points like "initiative in exploring AI," "awareness of potential," "willingness to learn," etc.
- For each strength, provide a 1-2 sentence elaboration. Use specific examples and details from the user's answers. Focus on tangible capabilities or practices that position them well for AI adoption, and explain why each is valuable in the context of the ${industry} industry.

**Weaknesses:**
- List at least 3-5 key weaknesses or improvement areas, each with a brief explanation of its potential impact on AI efficiency or marketing/sales efforts. Be constructive but honest, and connect weaknesses to the ${industry} context where possible.

## Strategic Action Plan
${actionPlanInstructions}

Provide a detailed, step-by-step action plan tailored to the user's tier and identified weaknesses. For this section:
  - Give at least 3-5 primary actionable recommendations, each targeting a specific improvement area.
  - For each recommendation, generate 2-4 specific, concrete sub-steps or examples of how the user could implement it.
  - MANDATE the integration of industry-specific use cases and advice for the ${industry} sector.
  - Ensure these actions are practical, detailed, and directly address the user's context.

## Getting Started & Resources

### Sample AI Goal-Setting Meeting Agenda
1. Generate a 3-4 point sample agenda specifically for the ${industry} sector, focusing on relevant AI adoption priorities.
2. Include specific discussion topics and measurable outcomes/next steps.

### Example Prompts for ${industry} Marketing Managers
- Create 2-3 actual example prompts that a marketing manager in ${industry} could immediately use.
- Format as "PROMPT: [actual prompt text]" and "USE CASE: [brief explanation]".

### Basic AI Data Audit Process Outline
1. Outline 3-4 key steps for conducting a basic AI data audit specifically relevant to ${industry} organizations.

## Illustrative Benchmarks
${benchmarksInstructions}

For the ${industry} industry, provide detailed, industry-specific benchmarks for ALL three tiers. Make sure each benchmark is HIGHLY RELEVANT to the ${industry} sector, with specific examples of tools, practices, or use cases that would be meaningful to organizations in this industry:

### Dabbler Tier Organizations
- Describe 2-3 concrete, realistic examples of how "Dabbler" tier organizations in ${industry} typically approach AI integration.
- Include specific tools, practices, or initial AI applications common at this tier.
- Highlight clear "first steps" or "low-hanging fruit" that ${industry} organizations at this tier typically focus on.

### Enabler Tier Organizations
- Describe 2-3 concrete examples of how "Enabler" tier organizations in ${industry} deploy more sophisticated AI capabilities.
- Include specific processes, tools, or metrics that differentiate them from Dabblers in the ${industry} sector.
- Focus on organizational structures, data integration practices, or automation that empowers scalable AI use.

### Leader Tier Organizations
- Describe 2-3 distinctive examples of how "Leader" tier organizations in ${industry} leverage advanced AI capabilities.
- Include specific initiatives, technologies, or strategic approaches that define excellence in ${industry}-specific AI adoption.
- Emphasize innovative practices that create significant competitive advantage in ${industry}.

IMPORTANT: After determining the user's tier, CONTEXTUALIZE these benchmarks by explicitly comparing where the organization currently stands versus the next tier they could aspire to. For example:
- If they're a "Dabbler", highlight what specifically separates them from "Enablers" in ${industry}.
- If they're an "Enabler", outline what specific steps would help them reach "Leader" status in ${industry}.
- If they're already a "Leader", emphasize what they should focus on maintaining/enhancing to stay at the cutting edge.

## Your Personalized AI Learning Path
${learningPathInstructions}

Based on your scorecard results, select 2-3 of the most relevant resources and provide a HIGHLY PERSONALIZED explanation for each.
