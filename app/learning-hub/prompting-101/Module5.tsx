      <h2>Module 5: Level Up - Iteration is Your Secret Weapon (From "Good" to "Truly Diamond")</h2>
      
      <p>Even with the most meticulously crafted prompts using all the Golden Keys and our "Diamond Standard" recipes, the AI's initial response might be 85-95% perfect, but not quite hit that 100% mark you're aiming for. It might be good, even very good, but is it <em>your</em> voice? Is it <em>exactly</em> what you envisioned?</p>
      
      <p>This is where the real artistry of AI collaboration comes in. What separates AI Dabblers from AI Directors is the mastery of <strong>iteration and refinement.</strong> Don't settle for "good enough."</p>
