# AI Use Case Prioritization Matrix Template

> Use this framework to evaluate and prioritize potential AI initiatives based on key business and technical factors. This helps focus resources on the most impactful opportunities first.

## Instructions:

1.  **List Use Cases:** In the table below, list each potential AI initiative or use case you are considering.
2.  **Score Criteria:** For each use case, score it against the defined criteria (typically 1-5, see definitions below).
3.  **Calculate Priority:** Use the suggested formula (or adapt it) to calculate a priority score.
4.  **Rank:** Order the use cases based on their priority score.

## Prioritization Criteria Definitions:

*   **(A) Potential Business Impact (Score 1-5):** How significantly could this initiative impact key business goals (e.g., revenue, cost savings, efficiency, customer experience)?
    *   *5 = Transformational Impact*
    *   *4 = High Impact*
    *   *3 = Moderate Impact*
    *   *2 = Low Impact*
    *   *1 = Minor Impact*
*   **(B) Implementation Effort/Cost (Score 1-5):** How much time, budget, technical resources, and organizational change are required?
    *   *5 = Very High Effort/Cost (Least Favorable)*
    *   *4 = High Effort/Cost*
    *   *3 = Moderate Effort/Cost*
    *   *2 = Low Effort/Cost*
    *   *1 = Very Low Effort/Cost (Most Favorable)*
    *   **Note:** A higher score for Effort/Cost is less favorable in the priority calculation.
*   **(C) Confidence / Data Availability (Score 1-5):** How confident are we in the technical feasibility, and what is the availability and quality of the required data?
    *   *5 = Very High Confidence / Data Ready & High Quality*
    *   *4 = High Confidence / Data Mostly Available*
    *   *3 = Moderate Confidence / Some Data Gaps or Quality Concerns*
    *   *2 = Low Confidence / Significant Data Gaps or Poor Quality*
    *   *1 = Very Low Confidence / Critical Data Missing or Unusable*
*   **(D) Strategic Alignment (Score 1-5):** How well does this initiative align with current, key business priorities and strategic objectives?
    *   *5 = Perfectly Aligned / Core to Strategy*
    *   *4 = Strongly Aligned*
    *   *3 = Moderately Aligned*
    *   *2 = Loosely Aligned*
    *   *1 = Poorly Aligned / Not a Strategic Fit*

**Note on Priority Score:** The formula `(Impact + Confidence + Strategic Alignment) - Effort/Cost` is a common starting point. You can adjust the weighting of criteria (e.g., `(2*A + C + D) - B`) or the formula itself to better reflect your organization's specific priorities and risk appetite. For instance, if minimizing effort is paramount, you might give 'Effort/Cost' a stronger negative weight or cap its impact.
