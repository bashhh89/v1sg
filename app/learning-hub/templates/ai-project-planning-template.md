# AI Project Planning Template

> This template provides a framework for planning your AI initiatives. Answer the questions thoughtfully to build a solid foundation for success.

## Phase 1: Strategy & Goal Definition
*Clearly defining the purpose, goals, and scope of your AI project is the first step towards success.*

*   **Problem Statement:**
    *   What specific business problem, challenge, or opportunity will this AI initiative address?
    *   Describe the current state, how this problem is currently handled, and the limitations of the current approach.
*   **Desired Outcome:**
    *   What does success look like for this initiative?
    *   How will things be demonstrably different or better after the AI solution is implemented?
*   **SMART Objectives:**
    *   Define clear, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals.
    *   (e.g., Increase lead score accuracy by 20% in Q3; Reduce report generation time by 5 hours/week within 60 days).
*   **Success Metrics (KPIs):**
    *   What specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) will be used to track progress towards the objectives?
    *   What are the current baseline values for these KPIs, if available? What are the target values?
*   **Stakeholders:**
    *   Identify key sponsors, champions, end-users, technical contacts, and subject matter experts.
    *   What are their respective roles, responsibilities, and expectations for this project?
*   **Scope Definition:**
    *   Clearly define what is IN scope for this specific project, phase, or iteration.
    *   Clearly define what is OUT of scope to manage expectations and prevent scope creep.
    *   Are there any known constraints (e.g., budget, timeline, resources)?

## Phase 2: Data Assessment & Readiness
*Data is the lifeblood of AI. This phase ensures you have the right quality and quantity of data.*

*   **Data Requirements:**
    *   What specific data sources (internal and/or external) are needed for this AI initiative?
    *   How will this data be accessed, collected, and ingested?
*   **Data Quality & Availability:**
    *   Evaluate the accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, and overall quality of the required data.
    *   Is there sufficient volume of data available for training, validation, and testing the AI model?
    *   Identify any gaps in data availability or quality and outline steps to address them.
*   **Data Representativeness & Bias:**
    *   Does the available data accurately reflect the real-world scenarios the AI will encounter?
    *   Are there potential biases (e.g., demographic, historical) present in the data that could lead to unfair or unintended outcomes? How will these be mitigated?
*   **Compliance & Ethics:**
    *   Outline all relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA), security protocols, and ethical considerations.
    *   Reference any internal data governance policies or industry-specific compliance requirements.
    *   _Consider referencing a detailed "Data Privacy & Compliance Checklist" if applicable._

## Phase 3: Technology & Solution Design
*Selecting the appropriate technology and designing the solution architecture are critical.*

*   **Technical Requirements:**
    *   List essential technical requirements for the AI solution, including integration points with existing systems, performance benchmarks, scalability needs, and security standards.
*   **Build vs. Buy Consideration:**
    *   Analyze the feasibility, pros, cons, and trade-offs of building a custom AI solution in-house versus leveraging existing vendor solutions or platforms.
    *   Consider factors such as cost, time-to-market, required expertise, customization needs, and long-term maintenance.
*   **Tool/Platform Selection:**
    *   If buying or using existing platforms, define clear criteria for evaluating and selecting the right AI tools, libraries, or platforms.
    *   *(Consider linking to the future 'AI Tool Comparison Framework' template here).*
*   **Infrastructure Needs:**
    *   Specify the computational resources (e.g., CPU, GPU, memory) and infrastructure (e.g., cloud, on-premise, hybrid) needed for development, training, deployment, and ongoing operation.
*   **Team Skills & Expertise:**
    *   Assess the required technical skills and domain expertise (e.g., data science, machine learning engineering, software development, DevOps) against the current team's capabilities.
    *   Identify any skill gaps and outline plans for training, upskilling, or hiring.
*   **Solution Architecture:**
    *   Provide a high-level overview of the proposed solution architecture, including key components and how they interact.

## Phase 4: Pilot Program & Implementation
*A pilot program allows for testing the solution on a smaller scale before full rollout.*

*   **Pilot Scope & Goals:**
    *   Define a limited, manageable scope for an initial pilot program.
    *   What specific hypotheses are being tested? What are the clear success criteria for the pilot?
*   **Pilot Users & Use Cases:**
    *   Identify the target users and specific use cases for the pilot program.
    *   How will these users be selected, recruited, and onboarded?
*   **Implementation Plan:**
    *   Outline the key milestones, tasks, deliverables, roles, responsibilities, and timelines for developing and deploying the pilot solution.
*   **Training & Onboarding:**
    *   Detail the plan for training pilot users and relevant stakeholders on using the AI solution and interpreting its outputs.
    *   What training materials or resources will be provided?
*   **Risk Management:**
    *   Identify potential risks during the pilot phase (e.g., technical, operational, data-related, user adoption).
    *   Develop mitigation strategies and contingency plans for these identified risks.

## Phase 5: Monitoring, Evaluation & Feedback
*Continuous monitoring and evaluation are key to understanding performance and gathering insights.*

*   **Baseline Comparison:**
    *   Document the pre-pilot baseline metrics (established in Phase 1 KPIs) to measure the impact of the AI solution accurately.
*   **Monitoring Strategy:**
    *   How will the defined KPIs, system performance, and model behavior be tracked during and after the pilot?
    *   What tools, dashboards, or processes will be used for monitoring? How frequently will performance be reviewed?
*   **Feedback Loop:**
    *   Define a structured process for collecting, analyzing, and acting upon feedback from pilot users and other stakeholders.
    *   What channels will be used (e.g., surveys, interviews, feedback forms, user testing sessions)?
*   **Evaluation Criteria:**
    *   How will the overall success and effectiveness of the pilot be evaluated against its goals and KPIs?

## Phase 6: Iteration, Scaling & Governance
*Based on pilot outcomes, the solution is refined, scaled, and put under long-term governance.*

*   **Pilot Analysis & ROI:**
    *   Comprehensively analyze the pilot results against the defined KPIs and objectives.
    *   Calculate the initial Return on Investment (ROI) or value delivered by the pilot.
    *   Document key learnings, insights, and any unexpected outcomes.
*   **Refinement Plan:**
    *   Based on pilot analysis and feedback, outline how learnings will be used to iterate, refine, and improve the solution (e.g., model adjustments, UI/UX changes, workflow optimizations).
*   **Scaling Strategy:**
    *   If the pilot is successful, define the criteria, strategy, and steps for a wider rollout or scaling the solution (e.g., to more users, departments, or use cases).
    *   Consider infrastructure scalability, resource allocation, and potential challenges.
*   **Change Management:**
    *   Develop a plan for managing the organizational change associated with broader adoption.
    *   This includes communication strategies, stakeholder engagement, and support for users transitioning to the new solution.
*   **Long-Term Governance:**
    *   Outline a plan for the ongoing maintenance, monitoring, performance management, and ethical oversight of the AI solution in production.
    *   How will the model be retrained or updated over time? Who is responsible for its long-term success and integrity?
