- Progress UI: Visual timeline of phases, progress bar, and question counter
- Answer Types: Supports text, single-choice, multiple-choice, and scale/rating inputs
- AI "Thinking" Display: Shows reasoning for each question (typing animation)
- Industry Selection: User selects their industry at the start

### Primary Deliverable: "Personalized Report"
- Automated Markdown Report generated by AI, including:
  - **Overall Tier:** (Dabbler, Enabler, Leader) based on answers
  - **Key Findings:** Strengths and weaknesses

## 4. Feature Deep Dive – "Personalized Report" Content

### Getting Started Resources
- **Expected Content:** Example agendas, prompt templates, data audit guides, AI strategy templates, etc.
- **Responsibility:** You (the developer) are expected to create or curate this content, possibly with AI assistance
- **Implementation:** Initially, links are placeholders. For "diamond" level, these should be real, high-quality resources, either as static pages, PDFs, or curated external links
- **Presentation:** Displayed as a list of links in the "Getting Started & Resources" section of the report

### Industry Benchmarking
- **Expectation:** For v1, brief, illustrative examples of what "Leaders" and "Enablers" do in the user's industry
- **Data Source:** AI-generated, based on industry input and tier
- **Presentation:** Markdown bullet points or short paragraphs in the "Illustrative Benchmarks" section

### Custom AI Learning Plan
- **Personalization:** Should be tailored to the user's answers and tier (e.g., "Dabbler" gets foundational resources, "Leader" gets advanced guides)
- **Content for URLs:** Each link should point to a resource (page, PDF, or curated link) relevant to the user's needs (e.g., "What is AI?", "How to run a data audit", "Best AI tools for [industry]")
- **Responsibility:** You should create a library of resources and have the AI select the most relevant ones, rather than generating unique content per user
- **Structure:** Presented as a step-by-step plan or checklist, with links and brief descriptions

- **Logos:** Social Garden branding to be used (not yet implemented in code)

## 8. Outstanding Questions & Ambiguities

- **Resource Content:** Who is responsible for finalizing and maintaining the resource library? Should it be 100% unique, or can it include curated third-party links?
- **Custom AI Learning Plan:** Is a fully dynamic, per-user plan required, or is a tiered, template-based approach sufficient?
- **Lead Capture:** What exact user info is required? Is there a privacy policy or consent language from Social Garden?
- **Branding:** Are there official Social Garden logos, fonts, or a style guide to use?
- **UI/UX Inspiration:** Is there a specific external site or competitor George wants to emulate?
- **Benchmarks:** Is AI-generated benchmarking sufficient, or does George want real, sourced industry data?
- **PDF/Email:** Should the PDF/email include all report sections, or just a summary?
- **Shareable Link:** Is this a must-have for launch, or post-launch enhancement?
- **Testing:** What browsers/devices are in scope for "gold" delivery?
